However, compare to the KNN classifier, KNN performs the best.  Logistic Regression performs better than the Naive Bayes and Naive Bayes performs the worst. \n","\n","This shows that there there might be more of a non-linear relationship between the 16 features and the output.\n","\n","Based on the performance of the Naive Bayes, we can say that there might be a lot of overlaps between features distributions.
